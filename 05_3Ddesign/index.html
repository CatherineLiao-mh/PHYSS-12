<h4>Model and 3D Print</h4>

<h4><b><u>Prusa Design</b></h4></u>

<p class = "margin"></p>

For lab, I decided to print a ring as a scaled down part of the jar I want to print. I faced some problems with Prusa design regrding it's settings on bgcode and gcode. Initially, I asked around to find out that many people had the same problem, then to changing the settings of the app by playing around with the preferences on the app.

<h4><b><u>Lab --> Jar!</b></h4></u>

The ring took about five minutes and assured me that my settings work

<h4><b><u> Scanning </b></h4></u>

<p class = "margin"></p>

I didn't get a turn on the 3D scanning but I ended up using my phone for scanning instead. I started off with my head phones but then realized the color was too dark for it to be scanned successfully. I ended up scanning a charging block.
