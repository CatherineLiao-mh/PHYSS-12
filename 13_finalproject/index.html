<h3><b><u> Final Project: Synethesia Box Project </b></h3></u>

A box that consists of three light strips, indicating high, middle, and bass which detects sounds of the enviornment and takes in its values and outputs colors on the light strip.  An ip address has functions to turn on and off or change colors of the led strips

<h4><b> MEMS Microphone Sensor </h4></b>

For the week 7 assignent I made an input sensor with my MEMS Microphone that I was planning on using for my final project.

<p class = "margin"></p>

I faced some problems on the inaccuracy of values when ranging the values of frequencies and sound but then found out it's because of the microphone not being completely connected, causing inaccuracies.

<p class = "margin"></p>

I ranged the values from low to high to indicate different frequencies. I used three light strips representing high, middle, and bass so that when the frequency/pitch reaches certain range the light strip lights up where as volume controls the amount of lights light up in each light strip.

The code finds the average and outputs that as the value and these were the results

<h4><b> Box Design </b></h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

I decided that 3D design would be the easiest and best looking way for the box. 


<p class = "margin"></p>

<img style = "width: 70%"
 src = "fusionFinal.png">

<p class = "margin"></p>

I designed it to look like a mini speaker/tv with a hole on the side for where the battery should be charged. The inner most dimensions fits a breadboard perfectly.

The print took a total of 12h44m but I ran into some issues with the machine where it just stops 2 hours in with the print saying it's done so I had to reprint.

<h4><b> Website Control </b></h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

After Networking week I wanted to have an ip address control over my final project. 


<p class = "margin"></p>

<img style = "width: 70%"
 src = "initialWebsite.jpg">

<p class = "margin"></p>

I started off with a simple IP address that controls on and off, then I added siri controls.

<p class = "margin"></p>

<img style = "width: 70%"
 src = "siriControl.jpg">

<p class = "margin"></p>

I then thought that if I were to make a synethesia box then that means it takes sound and outputs light but there should be a difference in colors depending on the sounds so I wanted a factor that controls the colors.
