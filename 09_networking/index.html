<h3>Week 9: Radio, WiFi, Bluetooth (IoT)</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Networking</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>


<h4><b><u> Ideas & Trial Runs </b></h4></u>

We initially started off with the idea of using an ESP32-Cam as a sensor for inputs of colors in the environment. We had ranges of colors to detect rgb as the serial monitor outputs different values for Red, Green, and Blue.


<p class = "margin"></p>

This is our code for it

<p class = "margin"></p>

<img style = "width: 60%"
 src = "rgbold1.png">

<p class = "margin"></p>

<img style = "width: 60%"
 src = "rgbold2.png">

<p class = "margin"></p>

 <img style = "width: 60%"
 src = "rgbold3.png">


<p class = "margin"></p>

A problem we had with this is to control the range of the three colors, and also that any color can be defined by rgb color code. 

<p class = "margin"></p>

  <source src="vacuum_process.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p class = "margin"></p>

This is a video of the outputs we get as we put different colors in front of the camera.

<p class = "margin"></p>

Then we started to realize that all colors in the environment (not only what in front of the camera) are being detected, so the values of RGB jumped a lot and had a wide range we have to control. So then we decided to focus on black and white, two specific unique colors that are easier to define.

<p class = "margin"></p>

<img style = "width: 60%"

<p class = "margin"></p>

 <img style = "width: 60%"

 <p class = "margin"></p>






<h4><b><u> LED Output </b></h4></u>

Something in common for our finals projects are LED strips so I decided to focus on that. With LED strips as my output, it was a simple setup.

<p class = "margin"></p>

<img style = "width: 60%"
 src = "LEDwiring.jpg">


<p class = "margin"></p>

This is the wiring for it, with GPIO 25.

<p class = "margin"></p>







With the coding, I set it up as two seperate websites with the IP Adress + /on or /off, determining the state of our LED strip


 <p class = "margin"></p>

 <img style = "width: 60%"
 src = "code4.png">

 <p class = "margin"></p>

 <img style = "width: 60%"
 src = "code5.png">


<p class = "margin"></p>

With two seperate websites, there are multiple ways to control the LED.

<p class = "margin"></p>

The website controls the LEDs and I had experience in apple shortcuts so I tried that out.

<p class = "margin"></p>

 <img style = "width: 40%"
 src = "websiteLED.jpg">



 <img style = "width: 40%"
 src = "shortcutLED.jpg">


<p class = "margin"></p>

With the websites working, it is really simple to pay around on Shortcuts by adding a new shortcut and including the website. This allows siri to access the ip adress on/off, turning LEDs on/off

<p class = "margin"></p>

We took inspiration from night lights and chose instead of shortcuts, to connect the camera color sensor we did at first with the LED light strips.

<h4><b><u> Design </b></h4></u>

<p class = "margin"></p>

<img style = "width: 40%"
 src = "pianoCNC.png">

<p class = "margin"></p>

I designed a piano based on its pattern with two black keys then three black keys. 

<p class = "margin"></p>
<p class = "margin"></p>

<video width="640" height="480" controls>
  <source src="process_piano.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p class = "margin"></p>

this is a fast forward video of the process

<p class = "margin"></p>
<p class = "margin"></p>

<img style = "width: 40%"

<p class = "margin"></p>

This is the final result

<p class = "margin"></p>




<h4><b><u> Molding and Casting </b></h4></u>

<p class = "margin"></p>

for molding and casting we decided to use Will's phone keychain

<img style = "width: 60%"
 src = "mold_process.jpg">

 <p class = "margin"></p>

 <img style = "width: 60%"
 src = "222.jpg">

 <p class = "margin"></p>

 <img style = "width: 60%"
 src = "111.jpg">

<p class = "margin"></p>

These are the process and results 

<p class = "margin"></p>






<h4><b><u> Vacuum Forming </b></h4></u>

<p class = "margin"></p>

After we were done with the piano, we decided to vacuum the piano

<p class = "margin"></p>

<video width="640" height="480" controls>
  <source src="vacuum_process.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p class = "margin"></p>

This is the process of the vacuum forming

<p class = "margin"></p>

 <img style = "width: 60%"
 src = "vacuum_result.jpg">

 <p class = "margin"></p>

 this is the result
