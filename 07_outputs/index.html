<h3>Week 7: Electronic Outputs</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Minimum Viable Product for Final Project</h4>






<h4><b><u> Structure Explained </b></h4></u>

<p class = "margin"></p>

I made a microphone sensor input and a touch sensor with led light output last assignment. This time I connected the ESP32 with the MEMS SPH0645 and three led light strips, each with 10 lights.

<p class = "margin"></p>

The MEMS microphone acts as a sensor that outputs different pitches and sound of it's environment while the led light has lights that light up one by one based on the output from MEMS.

<p class = "margin"></p>

There are three light strips one representing bass, one representing mid, and the last representing high.

<h4><b><u> Wiring </b></h4></u>

I did some research to understand the structure of an MEMS microphone. I found out what specific voltages and pins that has to be used in order for the project to work properly. 

<p class = "margin"></p>

SEL --> GND (I2S mode & common ground)
<br>LRCL --> GPIO 26</br>
DOUT --> GPIO 32
<br>BCLK --> GPIO 14</br>
GND --> GND (common ground)
<br>3V --> 3.3V</br>

<h4><b><u> Results </b></h4></u>

The outputs of the microphone shows up like this with background noise:
